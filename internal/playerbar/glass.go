// barGlass is the glass of the player bar: clearer and bending what shows
// through more than the glass plugin's, whose refraction is fixed. It follows
// the plugin's optics (its lens, normal and tone, see glass.hlsl), with these
// to tell it from them:
//
//   - it hardly blurs, so that what is under the bar can be read through its
//     flat middle;
//   - its curve reaches further in, on a rounder profile, and bends further,
//     so that the edges of the capsule visibly swim;
//   - red and blue bend a little apart, as through a thick lens;
//   - in place of a tint over everything, the lightness of what shows through
//     is squeezed: dark stays as it is, and only what is bright, which would
//     drown the bar's own words, comes down.
//
// clear and bend, from 0 to 1, are the listener's: clearer, it blurs less and
// lets more of what is bright through; bent more, the edge bends further, and
// its curve reaches further in. At 0.5 they are the glass as it was tuned.
